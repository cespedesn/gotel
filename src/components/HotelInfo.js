                <h2>Gotel Green Program</h2>
                <p><strong>The Gotel Hotel - SoHo</strong> recently underwent a renovation, and the environment was taken into consideration at every step. With energy-saving lighting and appliances, green building materials, and solar power - we're saving energy in every socket, outlet, and switch. In addition, we've started a recycling and composting program that reduces waste going to landfills, while providing valuable raw materials for new products or for use as compost in local gardens and landscapes.</p>
